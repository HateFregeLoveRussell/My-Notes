#### Theorem 1.19(The Existence Theorem):
There exists an ordered field $\large \Bbb R$ which has the [[Bounds and Bounded Sets#Definition 1.10|Least-Upper-Bound Property]]. Moreover, $\large \Bbb R$ contains $\large \Bbb Q$ as a subfield. The members of this field, known as the  **==Real Field==** are called **==Real Numbers==**.

##### Proof:
