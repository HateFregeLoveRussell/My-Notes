#### Definition 1.3:
- For a set $A$, $x \in A$ indicates membership, $x \notin A$ denotes that $x$ is not a member of $A$. 
- The set without any elements will be henceforth called ==**the empty set**==
- Any set with at least one element is called ==**non-empty**==
- If every element of set $A$ is also an element of set $B$ we say $A$ is a  ==**subset**==  of $B$  denoted $A \subset B$ or $B \supset A$ 
- If there exists an element of $B$ which is not in $A$ but $A \subset B$ we say that $A$ is a **==proper subset==** of $B$ 
- Note that if $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$ then we say $A = B$ otherwise $A \neq B$
#### Definition 1.4:
- Henceforth in this textbook the set of rational numbers will be denoted as $\large\Bbb{Q}$
