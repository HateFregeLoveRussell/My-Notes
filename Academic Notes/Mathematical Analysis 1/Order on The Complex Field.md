#### Introduction:
We managed to characterize the [[The Complex Field#Definition 1.24|The Complex Numbers]] as a [[Fields and Ordered Fields#Definition 1.12|Field]] but we neglected to define an [[Orders and Ordered Sets#Definition 1.5|Order]] on it in a way to conform to the axioms of an [[Fields and Ordered Fields#Definition 1.17|Ordered Field]]. This makes us wonder if it is possible to characterize [[The Complex Field#Definition 1.24|The Complex Numbers]] as an [[Fields and Ordered Fields#Definition 1.17|Ordered Field]].
