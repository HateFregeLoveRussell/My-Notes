#### Introduction:
We managed to characterize the [[The Complex Field#Definition 1.24|The Complex Numbers]] as a [[Fields and Ordered Fields#Definition 1.12|Field]] but we neglected to define an [[Orders and Ordered Sets#Definition 1.5|Order]] on it in a way to conform to the axioms of an [[Fields and Ordered Fields#Definition 1.17|Ordered Field]]. This makes us wonder if it is possible to characterize [[The Complex Field#Definition 1.24|The Complex Numbers]] as an [[Fields and Ordered Fields#Definition 1.17|Ordered Field]].

#### Solution: 
As shown in Chapter 1 Practice Problems: [[Question 9#Theorem 1.Q9|Problem 9]] and [[Question 8#Theorem 1.Q8|Problem 8]]. An [[Orders and Ordered Sets#Definition 1.5|Order]] can be defined on the set of [[The Complex Field#Definition 1.24|Complex Numbers]] but the existence of such an order would nullify the [[The Complex Field#Theorem 1.25|The Complex Field]].
