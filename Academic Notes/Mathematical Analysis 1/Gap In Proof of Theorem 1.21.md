#### Introduction: 
Most Gaps from the proof presented from the book to the one presented in the note have been resolved. The only remaining major gap to my knowledge is the proof of the identity $\large{b^n - a^n  = (b-a)(b^{n-1} + b^{n-2}a + \ldots + a^{n-1})}$ and it's implication of the inequality $\large{b^n - a^n < (b-a)nb^{n-1} }$
