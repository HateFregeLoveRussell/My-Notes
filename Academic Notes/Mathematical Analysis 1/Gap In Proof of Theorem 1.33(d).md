#### Introduction:
In the proof for [[Conjugates and Absolute Values#Theorem 1.33|Theorem 1.33(d and e)]] we never proved the intermediate step of $\large{a,b\in \Bbb R, a,b > 0 , a > b\implies \sqrt{a} > \sqrt {b}}$. Additionally we never proved the dual $\large{a,b\in \Bbb R, a,b > 0,a >b \implies a^n > b^n }$ which is used in [[Properties of the Real Field#Theorem 1.21|Theorem 1.21]].
