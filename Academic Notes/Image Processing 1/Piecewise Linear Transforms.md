#### Description: 
**==Piecewise Linear Transformations==** are a class of [[Intensity Transformations#Definition|Intensity Transformations]] characterized by Linear Piecewise Functions. The benefit of this approach is that Intensity Transformations of arbitrary complexity are achievable through such functions. The primary downside is that such functions almost always require human input in order to be properly defined.
