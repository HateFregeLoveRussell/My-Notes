### Overview
The following is a list of Topological Spaces used in the analysis of Configuration Spaces in this class. 

### Topological Spaces

##### Spherical Surface
The Circle's topology is represented with the symbol $\large\mathcal{S}$ or $\large\mathcal{S^1}$, higher dimensional versions of this topological space (such as the surface of a sphere $\large\mathcal{S^2}$) are represented through the notation $\large\mathcal{S}^n$ where $\large{n}$ represents the dimensionality of the surface. 

#### Euclidean Surfaces
The Line's topology is represented with the symbol $\large\mathbb{E}$ or $\large\mathbb{E^1}$ or $\large\mathbb{R}$ or $\large\mathbb{R^1}$, higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces (such as the plane $\large\mathbb{E^2, R^2}$) are represented through the notation $\large\mathbb{E}^n$ or $\large\mathbb{R}^n$ where $\large{n}$ represents the dimensionality of the space.

#### Torus Surface
The surface of the torus in three-dimensions is represented through the symbol $\large\mathcal{T^2}$. The surface of higher-dimensional tori can be represented through the notation $\large\mathcal{T^n}$  where $\large{n}$ represents the n-dimensional surface of the n+1-dimensional torus. Note that in general $\large n$ cartesian products of a single dimensional spherical space always equals an n dimensional Torus space. In other words: 
$\large{\mathcal{S}^1\times\mathcal{S}^1\times ... \times \mathcal{S}^1\times = \mathcal{T}^n \neq \mathcal{S}^n}$
