### Overview
Robots are composed of [[ECE 486 Component Dictionary#Link|Links]], [[ECE 486 Component Dictionary#Joints|Joints]] and Actuators (namely the [[ECE 486 Component Dictionary#End Effector|End Effector]]). In our analysis we will assume every link to be rigid, this will aid greatly in analysing a [[Robot Configuration|Configuration]]. Robots which do not use rigid links exist and are known as [[ECE 486 Component Dictionary#Soft-Bodied Robots|Soft Bodied Robots]].
