### Class Description:
##### Overview
Introduction to the field of Robotics, with a focus on the mechanics and control of serial manipulators. First half is focused on modelling kinematics, latter half builds with generating trajectories, formulating dynamic equations, and using them in robot control. This class does include a lab section.

##### Textbook
The class textbook is “Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control” by Professors Kevin Lynch and Frank Park. There is an expectation on the student to constantly read, and annotate the content on the Perusall platform prior to lectures.

Additional resources can be found on the author's [website](http://modernrobotics.org/).

##### Mark Breakdown
- Engagement based on active participation in Piazza and Perusall platforms (weight:: 10%)
- Chapter Quizzes With the lowest two being dropped, each quiz is worth 2.5% (weight:: 20%)
- Lab Deliverables (weight:: 30%)
- Course Project (weight:: 40%)

##### Chapter Quizzes
Quizzes occur on most Thursdays, once done, they will be redistributed randomly and graded by students after the solution is explained.

##### Labs
Each lab will lose 20% of it's maximum mark per 24 hours it is late, even when at 0% maximum mark the lab must be submitted in order to pass. 

##### Class Project
The Class Project consists of 6 deliverables, each of which have a coding and a report sub-deliverable. The "Report Due" deadline submission will give you initial partial feedback while the "Grading Starts" deadline acts as the grading deadline. Reports can be resubmitted until the later deadline.
