### Description
DT Control Systems are found in the overwhelming majority of practical settings in the modern day, the following is a list of popular applications in which Discrete-Time(Digital) Control Systems are often found. The second list are a series of demonstrative applications often used in research. 

### Practical Applications
- Robotics
- Autonomous Automotive Systems
- Healthcare
- Automated Warehouses
- Railway Traffic Scheduling 
- Energy Efficient Building Temperature Control
	- this topic has become of particular interest among some academic due to climate concern

### Demonstrative Applications
- Ball spun on a plate with the plate tilting to control ball trajectory
- Drone Control, in crowds or as individuals
- Autonomous Racing
	- Popular form of competition
		- famous one at UW: "F1tenth" Competition
