### Class Description:
##### Overview
This course is cantered around the fundamentals required to design, implement and analyse sampled-data and discrete-time control systems. This course will cover topics such as Dynamic System Modelling, with both transfer function and state-space, for both continuous and discrete time systems. Introductory non-linear system analysis. Digital control system design via emulation, z-transform, frequency-domain, and via pole displacement. Implementation of digital controllers. 
This class does have an in-person laboratory component.
The class textbook: Digital Control System Analysis and Design, 4th edition, C.L.  
Phillips, H.T. Nagle, A. Chakraborty. is entirely optional, and the lectures are done from prof notes.
