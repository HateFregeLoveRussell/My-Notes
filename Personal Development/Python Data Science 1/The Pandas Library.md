### Description

The Pandas Library is a package used to manipulate large amounts of data in a variety of forms. It is commonly used in situations necessitating Data Merging, Cleaning, and Pre-processing. This Library is built on top of the Numpy Library so many of the functionalities found in Numpy are also present in Pandas. 

Pandas mainly uses two objects to represent and manipulate data. The first is the [[Pandas Series|Series]] object, used in the case where the data to be represented is one-dimensional. To represent higher-dimensional data Pandas makes use of the [[Pandas Data Frame|Data Frame]] object.
