### Class Description:

```dataview
TABLE class.class-name AS "Class Name", class.instructor AS "Class Author", class.medium AS "Class Medium", class.length AS "Class Length"
WHERE file = this.file
```

Very beginner level class on how to use Python, with focus on Problem Solving principles in computer science, using python with zero prior programming experience, and using data science packages present in python. Due to prior skill level some portion of the course (especially around beginner level programming) will be omitted.
